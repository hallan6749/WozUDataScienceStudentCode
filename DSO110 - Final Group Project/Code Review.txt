Code Review
Please submit all project documents related to your efforts this week, including all code used. Your code will be graded on the following four criteria:

Does your code run smoothly from the top to the bottom of the file?
Do you have comments explaining what you're doing before you do it?
Are you working on the appropriate weekly task (i.e. data wrangling)?
Do you have comments explaining your interpretation of the code results (if applicable) after the code?
